🎓 **Student Course Management System (MERN Stack)** 🌐

Welcome to our comprehensive Student Course Management System built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack! This project aims to streamline and enhance the management of student courses, providing a user-friendly interface for administrators, instructors, and students alike.

🚀 **Key Features:**
- **User Roles:** Clearly defined roles for Admins, Instructors, and Students, ensuring secure access and functionality.
- **Course Management:** Effortlessly create, update, and organize courses with intuitive administrative tools.
- **Enrollment System:** Students can easily enroll in courses, while instructors have the ability to manage enrollments seamlessly.
- **Dynamic Dashboard:** Interactive dashboards for administrators and instructors, offering at-a-glance insights into course statistics and student progress.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication powered by JWT tokens, ensuring data integrity and user privacy.
- **Responsive Design:** A mobile-friendly interface that adapts to various devices, providing a consistent and enjoyable user experience.

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React.js with responsive design for a seamless user experience.
- **Backend:** Express.js and Node.js for robust server-side development.
- **Database:** MongoDB for efficient and scalable data storage.

🔗 **Getting Started:**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) (install globally)

**Create a file with the name "sample" and save all these files in it and install npm packages in it.**

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShadowSLayerrYT/Student-Course-Management-System.git
cd sample
```

## Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project root directory and install the necessary dependencies for both the client and server.

```bash
# Install client dependencies
cd client
npm install

# Install server dependencies
cd ../server
npm install
```

## Start the Server

Ensure you are in the `server` directory before starting the server.

```cmd
cd server
nodemon app.js
```

This will launch the Node.js server using nodemon, which automatically restarts on file changes.

## Start the React App

Open a new terminal window/tab, navigate to the `client` directory, and start the React app.

```cmd
cd client
npm start
```

Your React app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and the Node.js server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Notes

- Make sure to have separate terminal instances for running the server and the React app.
- You can customize the server configurations in the `server/app.js` file.
- Ensure your firewall settings allow connections to the specified ports.

This is how the final database in the backend (MongoDBCompass) should be looking like , make sure to use the same classes and sub-classes for accurate results.
